(Only the top)

Everything fits together with 4 m3 screws and bolts. The original design did not include a top, but i added it after it was requested.

## Firmware

I wrote the firmware using kmk, you can see it inside the repo. [](/Firmware%20and%20drivers/drivers.main.py)

## Notes
Making the pad was fun!The original design did not include a top, but i added it after it was requested.
